# Welcome
Ethereum vulnerabilities and exploits is a project undertaken as part of the [Chainshot Ethereum Bootcamp](https://www.chainshot.com/). Students are tasked with an end of course project, and the objective of _this_ project was to use the knowledge from the course and drill it home by using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) with [Alchemyapi](https://alchemyapi.io/) to reproduce several hacks and exploits.

# The repositories
Each repository is a standalone representation of a hack; they can be downloaded, installed and ran to reproduce the event. The readme.md for each repo provides more insight to what happened, and then the test scripts in the repos will log out the events as they occur.
